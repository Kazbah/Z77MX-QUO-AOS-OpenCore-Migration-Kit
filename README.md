# Z77MX-QUO-AOS: OpenCore Migration Kit

This project was originally intended to help with the migration from OZ to better maintained and more extensive OpenCore bootloader utility, for the small community of users who use the QUO any os motherboard.

It's new intention is to maintain and continue updating to the latest compatible version of OpenCore for the same user base.

Our latest version is based on [OpenCore 0.8.6](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/tag/0.8.6)
